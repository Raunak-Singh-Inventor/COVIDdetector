  Circuit 4A-HelloWorld

  The LCD will display the words "Hello World" and show how many seconds have passed since
  the RedBoard was last reset.

  This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community.

#include <LiquidCrystal.h>          //the liquid crystal library contains commands for printing to the display

LiquidCrystal lcd(13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8);   // tell the RedBoard what pins are connected to the display

void setup() {

  lcd.begin(16, 2);                 //tell the lcd library that we are using a display that is 16 characters wide and 2 characters high
  lcd.clear();                      //clear the display
}

void loop() {

  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);              //set the cursor to the 0,0 position (top left corner)
  lcd.print("Hello, world!");       //print hello, world! starting at that position

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);              //move the cursor to the first space of the bottom row
  lcd.print(millis() / 1000);       //print the number of seconds that have passed since the last reset
}
